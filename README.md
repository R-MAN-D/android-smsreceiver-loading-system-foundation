# Android SMS Receiver (Loading System Foundation)

# App Goal
This app will receive incoming SMS and will eventually parse the message, and depending on the sent code, that will be the amount of top-up/load the subscriber will receive.

Example:

Send <b>123BB</b> to <b>0939XXXXXXX</b> to receive 300 worth of load.
